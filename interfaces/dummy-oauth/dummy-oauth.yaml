        This endpoint serves the signing key(s) the client uses to validate

        which are used by clients to encrypt requests to the server.

        When both signing and encryption keys are made available, a "use"
        (public key use) parameter value is REQUIRED for all keys in the
        referenced JWK Set to indicate each key's intended usage.

            JSON array containing a list of the OAuth 2.0 "response_type" values that this authorization server supports. These values are required for responses from calls to the authorization endpoint, thus this array may be empty if no grant flows use the authorization endpoint, thus this server returns an empty array. (definitions in RFC 7591)
            This field is required per RFC 8414, but this auth server does not support the flows that use this field, thus an empty array is returned.
