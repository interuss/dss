# aux interface

The `aux` interface exposed by InterUSS DSS instances includes endpoints and operations for interacting with specific features of the InterUSS DSS implementations which are not part of standards-defined APIs.

One activity some `aux` operations enable is [DSS pool monitoring](../../deploy/operations/monitoring.md#health-checks).
