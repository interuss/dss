          `FlightAuthorisationValidation`: USS supports EU flight authorisation
            parameter validation.

          `BasicStrategicConflictDetection`: USS supports strategic conflict
            detection for typical flights, including future planning (Accepted
            operational intents), activation (Accepted operational intents), and
            closing (deleting the operational intent reference).

          `HighPriorityFlights`: USS supports flights at priority levels higher
            than typical flights.
