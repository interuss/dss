# This script builds InterUSS docker images and may be run from any working
# directory.  If run without a DOCKER_URL environment variable, it will just
# build images named interuss-local/*.  If DOCKER_URL is present, it will both
# build the versioned dss image and push it to the DOCKER_URL remote.
# If DOCKER_URL is set:
#
# 1) DOCKER_UPDATE_LATEST can be optionally set to `true` in order to publish
# the latest tag along the version.
#
# 2) DOCKER_SIGN can be optionally set to `true` in order to sign the published
# image using sigstore. When ran within the Github Actions CI, the identity of
# the CI workflow will be used through the ID token emitted by GitHub. When ran
# outside of the CI, `cosign` will interactively ask for an authentication
# against a supported identity provider (Google, GitHub or Microsoft at this time).
# If DOCKER_SIGN is `true`, CERT_IDENTITY and CERT_ISSUER must be set in order
# to verify the signature of the published image.
