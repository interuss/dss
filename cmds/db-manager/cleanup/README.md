# DB Cleanup

## evict
CLI tool that lists and deletes expired entities in the DSS store.
At the time of writing this README, the entities supported by this tool are:
- SCD operational intents;
- SCD subscriptions;
- RID identification service areas;
- RID subscriptions.

The usage of this tool is potentially dangerous: inputting wrong parameters may result in loss of data.
As such it is strongly recommended to always review and validate the list of entities identified as expired, and to
ensure that a backup of the data is available before deleting anything using the `--delete` flag.

### Performance impact
The current implementation of this tool might have a performance impact due notably to lock contention if the number of
entities to be removed is high. With the system under heavy load it might even fail to remove them. That is due to the
fact that the expired entities are all identified and removed within a single transaction: with concurrent competing
transactions succeeding faster, there might be enough failures so that the tool fails. There is no risk of data
inconsistency and the cleanup may just be tried again in that case.

To avoid this issue:
- perform the cleanup during a low intensity period (e.g. at night);
- iteratively cleanup the entities by starting with a lower TTL and progressively making it higher.

If this becomes enough of an issue in the future it could be considered implementing batching of removals.

### Usage
Extract from running `db-manager evict --help`:
```
List and evict expired entities

Usage:
  db-manager evict [flags]

Flags:
      --delete            set this flag to true to delete the expired entities
  -h, --help              help for evict
      --locality string   self-identification string of this DSS instance
      --rid_isa           set this flag to true to check for expired RID ISAs (default true)
      --rid_sub           set this flag to true to check for expired RID subscriptions (default true)
      --scd_oir           set this flag to true to check for expired SCD operational intents (default true)
      --scd_sub           set this flag to true to check for expired SCD subscriptions (default true)
      --ttl duration      time-to-live duration used for determining SCD entries expiration, defaults to 2*56 days which should be a safe value in most cases (default 2688h0m0s)

Global Flags:
      --cockroach_application_name string   application name for tagging the connection to cockroach (default "dss")
      --cockroach_db_name string            application name for tagging the connection to cockroach
      --cockroach_host string               cockroach host to connect to
      --cockroach_max_retries int           maximum number of attempts to retry a query in case of contention, default is 100 (default 100)
      --cockroach_port int                  cockroach port to connect to (default 26257)
      --cockroach_ssl_dir string            directory to ssl certificates. Must contain files: ca.crt, client.<user>.crt, client.<user>.key
      --cockroach_ssl_mode string           cockroach sslmode (default "disable")
      --cockroach_user string               cockroach user to authenticate as (default "root")
      --max_conn_idle_secs int              maximum amount of time in seconds a connection may be idle, default is 30 seconds (default 30)
      --max_open_conns int                  maximum number of open connections to the database, default is 4 (default 4)

```

Do note:
- by default expired entities are only listed, not deleted, the flag `--delete` is required for deleting entities;
- expiration of entities is preferably determined through their end times, however when they do not have end times, the last update times are used;
- the flag `--ttl` accepts durations formatted as [Go `time.Duration` strings](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration), e.g. `24h`;
- the flag `--ttl` is only used for SCD entities. RID entities will use an 30 minutes interval;
- the CockroachDB cluster connection flags are the same as [the `core-service` command](../../core-service/README.md).

### Examples
The following examples assume a running DSS deployed locally through [the `run_locally.sh` script](../../../build/dev/standalone_instance.md).

#### List all entities older than 1 week
```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose_dss.yaml -p dss_sandbox exec local-dss-core-service db-manager evict \
 --cockroach_host=local-dss-crdb --ttl=168h
```

#### List operational intents older than 1 week
```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose_dss.yaml -p dss_sandbox exec local-dss-core-service db-manager evict \
 --cockroach_host=local-dss-crdb --ttl=168h --scd_oir=true --scd_sub=false
```

#### Delete all entities older than 30 days
```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose_dss.yaml -p dss_sandbox exec local-dss-core-service db-manager evict \
 --cockroach_host=local-dss-crdb --ttl=720h --delete
```
