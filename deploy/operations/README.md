# Operations

This folder contains the instructions and related material used to operate a DSS. It is responsible to provide diagnostic capabilities and utilities to operate the DSS instance, such as certificates management.

Currently, the operations scripts are located inside [build](../../build) and if using the [infrastructure layer](../infrastructure), helpers are generated in the workspace directory by terraform after deployment.

As a complete example, the configuration files [used by the CI job](../../.github/workflows/dss-deploy.yml) of the [infrastructure](../infrastructure) and [servics](../services) layers are located in [ci](./ci).
