# USS to USS Discovery and Synchronization [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/interuss/dss?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/interuss/dss)

This repository contains InterUSS's implementation of the Discovery and Synchronization Service (DSS) from multiple ASTM standards. See the [InterUSS website](https://interuss.org) for background information.

## Discovery and Synchronization Service (DSS)

The DSS is a simple and open service used by separate USSs, often in different organizations, to communicate
information about UAS operations and coordinate with each other. This service is described in the ASTM remote
ID standard and ASTM USS interoperability standard. This flexible and distributed system is used to connect
multiple USSs operating in the same general area to share information while protecting operator and consumer
privacy. The system is focused on facilitating communication amongst actively operating USSs without details
about UAS operations stored in or processed by the DSS.
